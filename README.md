<p>I'm Sabrina, a 2nd year software engineering student at Ã‰cole de technologie supÃ©rieure based in MontrÃ©al, Canada. I have started programing about 3 years ago, first learning HTML and CSS to explore web design. After learning multiple other languages at university, I'm currently learning React.js and Spring boot as part of a personnal project.</p>
